## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Web reference for binary challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: binary
- Tools: ida, netcat
- Techniques: command-injection, ret2libc, reverse-engineering

## First-Principles Route

- Identify the exposed entry point, reflected behavior, trust boundary, and any explicit hints or blacklists.
- Validate the suspected primitive with the smallest payload that proves code/data/control influence.
- Chain the primitive into file read, code execution, auth bypass, or state manipulation only after recording the bypass condition.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `reverse engineering`
- Why: Reverse routes pivot from strings/imports into the exact validation or decoding logic.
- Probe: Use ida, netcat to locate strings, comparisons, and control-flow decisions relevant to the input.
- Tools: ida, netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as reverse engineering.
  - Use ida, netcat to locate strings, comparisons, and control-flow decisions relevant to the input.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: CTF-rootme 题解之Python - input()_weixin_30612769的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `command execution path`
- Why: Command execution routes should separate syntax proof, filter bypass, and final file-read or shell step.
- Probe: Use ida, netcat to verify command execution or shell expansion with a tiny proof command before reading the target file.
- Tools: ida, netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as command execution path.
  - Use ida, netcat to verify command execution or shell expansion with a tiny proof command before reading the target file.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `13373439872909134298363103573901`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
