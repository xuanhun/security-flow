## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Web reference for linux-logs, web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: linux-logs, web-app
- Tools: netcat
- Techniques: dns-analysis, http-analysis, php-tricks, waf-bypass, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Identify the exposed entry point, reflected behavior, trust boundary, and any explicit hints or blacklists.
- Validate the suspected primitive with the smallest payload that proves code/data/control influence.
- Chain the primitive into file read, code execution, auth bypass, or state manipulation only after recording the bypass condition.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: 2019 0CTF/TCTF wallbreaker easy 题目理解_youGuess28的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `> 来源：[https://blog.csdn.net/littlelittlebai/article/details/88966783](https://blog.csdn.net/littlelittlebai/article/details/88966783)`

### Step 3: 前言

- Route type: `waf bypass`
- Why: WAF cases are best solved by isolating one blocked token at a time and preserving a working bypass pattern.
- Probe: Use netcat to isolate the blocked token, then vary encoding, transport, syntax, or indirection until the primitive survives filtering.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as waf bypass.
  - Use netcat to isolate the blocked token, then vary encoding, transport, syntax, or indirection until the primitive survives filtering.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `看到还有其他的方法来做这个题目。先把通过`LD_PRELOAD`做的方法记录下来，再接着去看其他方法。`

### Step 4: WriteUp

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.

- Probe: Use netcat to isolate the blocked token, then vary encoding, transport, syntax, or indirection until the primitive survives filtering.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:

  - Use netcat to isolate the blocked token, then vary encoding, transport, syntax, or indirection until the primitive survives filtering.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.

### Step 6: 参考

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - The proof is the request or response field such as Host, URI, header, body, or status.
- Evidence rule: The proof is the request or response field such as Host, URI, header, body, or status.

### Step 7: 方法三

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
