## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Crypto reference for ciphertext challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: ciphertext
- Tools: netcat
- Techniques: crypto-analysis, encoding-analysis, php-tricks

## First-Principles Route

- Classify the cipher family, encoding layer, and available known-plaintext or structural clues before writing code.
- Separate transport/encoding cleanup from the actual cryptographic break so each assumption can be verified.
- Keep one reproducible decode or solve path that explains why the recovered plaintext is trustworthy.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Crypto, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: KCTF2019 Q3 签到题WP_飞鸿踏雪（蓝屏选手）的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `> 来源：[https://blog.csdn.net/qq_41252520/article/details/101371671](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_41252520/article/details/101371671)`

### Step 3: 前言

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Crypto, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `* 从这一次开始制定了新规则后，本来就是菜鸡的我连签到题都跪了。┭┮﹏┭┮。赛后看到别人的题解才知道自己栽在了哪里。`

### Step 4: 分析

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Crypto, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.

### Step 5: EXP

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Crypto, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
