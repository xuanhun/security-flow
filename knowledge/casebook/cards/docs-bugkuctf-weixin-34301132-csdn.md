## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Misc reference for web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: web-app
- Tools: not detected
- Techniques: web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Classify the artifact first: encoding, media, archive, QR, traffic, document, or mixed puzzle.
- Use the cheapest extraction or decoding pass that can confirm the intended modality before branching out.
- Treat each recovered clue as a pivot into the next artifact instead of assuming the first visible string is final.

## Linked Assets

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Misc, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: BugkuCTF 你必须让他停下_weixin_34301132的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `f19820d62a3551296c83bb35a1244ce6`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
