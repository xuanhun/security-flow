## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Web reference for web-app, web-service challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: web-app, web-service
- Tools: burp
- Techniques: command-injection, crypto-analysis, http-analysis, ret2libc, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Identify the exposed entry point, reflected behavior, trust boundary, and any explicit hints or blacklists.
- Validate the suspected primitive with the smallest payload that proves code/data/control influence.
- Chain the primitive into file read, code execution, auth bypass, or state manipulation only after recording the bypass condition.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `burp-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
