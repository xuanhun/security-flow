## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Web reference for web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: web-app
- Tools: netcat
- Techniques: dns-analysis, http-analysis, sql-injection, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Identify the exposed entry point, reflected behavior, trust boundary, and any explicit hints or blacklists.
- Validate the suspected primitive with the smallest payload that proves code/data/control influence.
- Chain the primitive into file read, code execution, auth bypass, or state manipulation only after recording the bypass condition.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: CG-CTF WEB 解题记录 11-15_aap49042的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.

### Step 3: Download~!

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `b860e37a876d9838ed3c8a9583a66c8f`

### Step 4: COOKIE

- Route type: `credential discovery`
- Why: When a capture or logs mention a cleartext protocol, check credentials and followed streams before expensive analysis.
- Probe: Use netcat to inspect credentials, authentication fields, or followed streams before deeper analysis.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as credential discovery.
  - Use netcat to inspect credentials, authentication fields, or followed streams before deeper analysis.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `2e12fb93a54effd6303f857d826b0067`

### Step 5: MYSQL

- Route type: `dns pivot`
- Why: DNS questions usually reduce to source host, resolver, queried name, response, or packet number pivots.
- Probe: Use netcat to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as dns pivot.
  - Use netcat to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `b7e5cea5dcac6f79704a561db9582386`

### Step 6: GBK Injection

- Route type: `sql injection exploitation`
- Why: SQLi cases are cheapest when the injection style is classified early and every response difference is recorded.
- Probe: Use netcat to confirm injection context, then narrow to the cheapest boolean, union, error, or stacked route that leaks proof.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as sql injection exploitation.
  - Use netcat to confirm injection context, then narrow to the cheapest boolean, union, error, or stacked route that leaks proof.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `338a1bb139579f5b307bc4036573de78`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
