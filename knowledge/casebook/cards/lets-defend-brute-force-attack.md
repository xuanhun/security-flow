# Brute Force Attack

## Case Metadata

- Category: `Network Forensics`
- Platform: `LetsDefend`
- Difficulty: `Medium`
- Source PDF: `https://github.com/tim-barc/ctf_writeups/blob/main/writeups/lets_defend_brute_force_attack.pdf`

## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Network Forensics reference for linux-logs, pcap challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: linux-logs, pcap
- Tools: wireshark
- Techniques: http-analysis, network-forensics, service-enumeration

## First-Principles Route

- Inventory capture files and identify dominant protocols, endpoints, and conversations.
- Prioritize cleartext protocols, credentials, DNS, HTTP objects, files, and suspicious long sessions.
- Use packet filters or stream following to connect each question to a specific packet, stream, or extracted object.
- When a file is recovered from traffic, pivot into file metadata and strings before deeper analysis.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: What is the IP address of the server targeted by the attacker’s brute-force attack?

- Route type: `conversation statistics`
- Why: Packet-count questions usually reduce to conversation statistics after endpoint and protocol constraints are fixed.
- Probe: Use wireshark to inspect conversation statistics or packet counts for the constrained endpoints and protocol.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as conversation statistics.
  - Use wireshark to inspect conversation statistics or packet counts for the constrained endpoints and protocol.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `192.168.190.137`

### Step 2: Which directory was targeted by the attacker’s brute-force attempt?

- Route type: `wireshark-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Network Forensics, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use wireshark to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as wireshark-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use wireshark to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `index.php`

### Step 3: Identify the correct username and password combination used for login.

- Route type: `credential discovery`
- Why: When a capture or logs mention a cleartext protocol, check credentials and followed streams before expensive analysis.
- Probe: Use wireshark to inspect credentials, authentication fields, or followed streams before deeper analysis.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as credential discovery.
  - Use wireshark to inspect credentials, authentication fields, or followed streams before deeper analysis.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `web-hacker:admin12345`

### Step 4: How many user accounts did the attacker attempt to compromise via RDP brute-force?

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use wireshark to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use wireshark to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `Or count manually:`

### Step 5: What is the “clientName” of the attacker’s machine?

- Route type: `wireshark-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Network Forensics, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use wireshark to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as wireshark-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use wireshark to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `clientName:`

### Step 6: When did the user last successfully log in via SSH, and who was it?

- Route type: `credential discovery`
- Why: When a capture or logs mention a cleartext protocol, check credentials and followed streams before expensive analysis.
- Probe: Use wireshark to inspect credentials, authentication fields, or followed streams before deeper analysis.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as credential discovery.
  - Use wireshark to inspect credentials, authentication fields, or followed streams before deeper analysis.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `The answer is therefore mmox:11:43:54.`

### Step 7: How many unsuccessful SSH connection attempts were made by the attacker?

- Route type: `credential discovery`
- Why: When a capture or logs mention a cleartext protocol, check credentials and followed streams before expensive analysis.
- Probe: Use wireshark with the extracted filter/query `All we need to do is count the number of log entries that contains “failed password”. We can do` and inspect the matching evidence.
- Tools: wireshark
- Filters or commands:
  - `All we need to do is count the number of log entries that contains “failed password”. We can do`
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as credential discovery.
  - Use wireshark with the extracted filter/query `All we need to do is count the number of log entries that contains “failed password”. We can do` and inspect the matching evidence.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `this by entering:`

### Step 8: What technique is used to gain access?

- Route type: `wireshark-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Network Forensics, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use wireshark to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as wireshark-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use wireshark to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `that the ATT&CK ID is T1110.`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
