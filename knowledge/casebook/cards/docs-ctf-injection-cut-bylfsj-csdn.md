## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Web reference for web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: web-app
- Tools: not detected
- Techniques: crypto-analysis, dns-analysis, php-tricks, sql-injection

## First-Principles Route

- Identify the exposed entry point, reflected behavior, trust boundary, and any explicit hints or blacklists.
- Validate the suspected primitive with the smallest payload that proves code/data/control influence.
- Chain the primitive into file read, code execution, auth bypass, or state manipulation only after recording the bypass condition.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: 一道审计型注入CTF题解（injection_cut）_bylfsj的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `sql injection exploitation`
- Why: SQLi cases are cheapest when the injection style is classified early and every response difference is recorded.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to confirm injection context, then narrow to the cheapest boolean, union, error, or stacked route that leaks proof.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as sql injection exploitation.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to confirm injection context, then narrow to the cheapest boolean, union, error, or stacked route that leaks proof.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `$username = $_SESSION['username'];`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
