# Disgruntled

## Case Metadata

- Category: `Endpoint Forensics`
- Platform: `TryHackMe`
- Difficulty: `Easy`
- Source PDF: `https://github.com/tim-barc/ctf_writeups/blob/main/writeups/disgruntled.pdf`

## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Endpoint Forensics reference for email, linux-logs challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: email, linux-logs
- Tools: not detected
- Techniques: browser-forensics

## First-Principles Route

- Start from artifact inventory: event logs, registry hives, browser data, file system timelines, memory, and application databases.
- Build a timeline around the suspicious user, process, file path, login, persistence item, or network connection.
- Correlate logs with file and registry evidence before trusting one artifact alone.
- Extract concrete indicators such as process names, command lines, hashes, timestamps, users, and persistence locations.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: logs, what is the full COMMAND?

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - The proof is the request or response field such as Host, URI, header, body, or status.
- Evidence rule: The proof is the request or response field such as Host, URI, header, body, or status.

### Step 2: What was the present working directory (PWD) when the previous command was run?

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Endpoint Forensics, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - The proof is the smallest artifact field that directly answers the goal.
- Evidence rule: The proof is the smallest artifact field that directly answers the goal.

### Step 3: Which user was created after the package from the previous task was installed?

- Route type: `timeline reconstruction`
- Why: Timeline questions should be answered from normalized artifact timestamps with timezone assumptions recorded.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to align timestamps and identify the event that satisfies the question.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as timeline reconstruction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to align timestamps and identify the event that satisfies the question.
  - The proof is the timestamped artifact that matches the question constraint.
- Evidence rule: The proof is the timestamped artifact that matches the question constraint.

### Step 4: which contain the adduser keyword:

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Endpoint Forensics, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `The name of the user is ‘it-admin’.`

### Step 5: A user was then later given sudo privileges. When was the sudoers file updated?

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Endpoint Forensics, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - The proof is the smallest artifact field that directly answers the goal.
- Evidence rule: The proof is the smallest artifact field that directly answers the goal.

### Step 6: When we investigated the auth.log for the previous question, we can see that the it-admin user

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `10.10.158.38:8080`

### Step 7: When was the file from the previous question last modified?

- Route type: `timeline reconstruction`
- Why: Timeline questions should be answered from normalized artifact timestamps with timezone assumptions recorded.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to align timestamps and identify the event that satisfies the question.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as timeline reconstruction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to align timestamps and identify the event that satisfies the question.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `The answer is ‘Dec 28 06:29’.`

### Step 8: What is the name of the file that will get created when the file from the first question executes?

- Route type: `timeline reconstruction`
- Why: Timeline questions should be answered from normalized artifact timestamps with timezone assumptions recorded.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to align timestamps and identify the event that satisfies the question.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as timeline reconstruction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to align timestamps and identify the event that satisfies the question.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `os-update.sh`

### Step 9: At what time will the malicious file trigger?

- Route type: `timeline reconstruction`
- Why: Timeline questions should be answered from normalized artifact timestamps with timezone assumptions recorded.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to align timestamps and identify the event that satisfies the question.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as timeline reconstruction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to align timestamps and identify the event that satisfies the question.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
