## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Web reference for web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: web-app
- Tools: detect-it-easy, netcat
- Techniques: dns-analysis, http-analysis, sql-injection, waf-bypass, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Identify the exposed entry point, reflected behavior, trust boundary, and any explicit hints or blacklists.
- Validate the suspected primitive with the smallest payload that proves code/data/control influence.
- Chain the primitive into file read, code execution, auth bypass, or state manipulation only after recording the bypass condition.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `detect-it-easy-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use detect-it-easy, netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: detect-it-easy, netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as detect-it-easy-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use detect-it-easy, netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: BUUCTF__[CISCN2019 华北赛区 Day2 Web1]Hack World_题解_风过江南乱的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use detect-it-easy, netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: detect-it-easy, netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use detect-it-easy, netcat to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `> 来源：[https://blog.csdn.net/tm_1024/article/details/106978766](https://blog.csdn.net/tm_1024/article/details/106978766)`

### Step 3: 前言

### Step 4: 读题

- Route type: `sql injection exploitation`
- Why: SQLi cases are cheapest when the injection style is classified early and every response difference is recorded.
- Probe: Use detect-it-easy, netcat to confirm injection context, then narrow to the cheapest boolean, union, error, or stacked route that leaks proof.
- Tools: detect-it-easy, netcat

  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.

### Step 7: 题目源码

- Route type: `sql injection exploitation`
- Why: SQLi cases are cheapest when the injection style is classified early and every response difference is recorded.
- Probe: Use detect-it-easy, netcat with the extracted filter/query `$blackList = array(' ','||','#','-',';','&','+','or','and','`','"','insert','group','limit','update','delete','*','into','union','load_file','outfile','./');` and inspect the matching evidence.
- Tools: detect-it-easy, netcat
- Filters or commands:
  - `$blackList = array(' ','||','#','-',';','&','+','or','and','`','"','insert','group','limit','update','delete','*','into','union','load_file','outfile','./');`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
