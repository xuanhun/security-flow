## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Misc reference for web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: web-app
- Tools: not detected
- Techniques: dns-analysis, http-analysis, misc-analysis, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Classify the artifact first: encoding, media, archive, QR, traffic, document, or mixed puzzle.
- Use the cheapest extraction or decoding pass that can confirm the intended modality before branching out.
- Treat each recovered clue as a pivot into the next artifact instead of assuming the first visible string is final.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: [KPCTF 2024 初赛]小明的旅游日记

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `- 考点清单：以图搜图, 文字推理, uuid-v5, AI 辅助代码生成`

### Step 2: 字符串拼接格式化输出 NSSCTF{result_uuid}

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Misc, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `print("NSSCTF{%s}" % result_uuid)`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
