# PowerShell Analysis - Keylogger

## Case Metadata

- Category: `Malware Analysis`
- Platform: `BTLO`
- Difficulty: `Easy`
- Source PDF: `https://github.com/tim-barc/ctf_writeups/blob/main/writeups/btlo_powershell_analysis_keylogger.pdf`

## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Malware Analysis reference for email challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: email
- Tools: not detected
- Techniques: not detected

## First-Principles Route

- Classify the artifact and packer/runtime before deep reversing.
- Extract strings, imports, capabilities, configuration, embedded URLs, hashes, and persistence behavior.
- Correlate static indicators with sandbox or process-monitor evidence when available.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: What is the SHA256 hash value for the PowerShell script file?

- Route type: `indicator enrichment`
- Why: Threat-intel enrichment is only useful after local extraction of stable indicators.
- Probe: Extract local indicators first, then enrich hashes, domains, IPs, or malware names.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as indicator enrichment.
  - Extract local indicators first, then enrich hashes, domains, IPs, or malware names.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.

### Step 2: What is the password for this email account?

- Route type: `credential discovery`
- Why: When a capture or logs mention a cleartext protocol, check credentials and followed streams before expensive analysis.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect credentials, authentication fields, or followed streams before deeper analysis.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as credential discovery.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect credentials, authentication fields, or followed streams before deeper analysis.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `being defined in the Pass variable:`

### Step 3: What DLL is imported to help record keystrokes?

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Malware Analysis, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `user32.dll`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
