## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Crypto reference for ciphertext challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: ciphertext
- Tools: not detected
- Techniques: crypto-analysis, encoding-analysis

## First-Principles Route

- Classify the cipher family, encoding layer, and available known-plaintext or structural clues before writing code.
- Separate transport/encoding cleanup from the actual cryptographic break so each assumption can be verified.
- Keep one reproducible decode or solve path that explains why the recovered plaintext is trustworthy.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Crypto, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: BUUCTF RSA1 解题代码以及详细公式推导_拔草能手晓寒的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `cipher decoding`
- Why: Crypto cases should peel encodings first and keep every transformation individually checkable.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as cipher decoding.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
