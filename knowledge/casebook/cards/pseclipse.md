## Case Metadata

- Category: `SIEM (ELK, Splunk, etc.)`
- Platform: `TryHackMe`
- Difficulty: `Medium`
- Source PDF: `https://github.com/tim-barc/ctf_writeups/blob/main/writeups/pseclipse.pdf`

## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a SIEM (ELK, Splunk, etc.) reference for email, ids, siem challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: email, ids, siem, windows-events
- Tools: elk, splunk, virustotal
- Techniques: cti-enrichment, dns-analysis, http-analysis, siem-query, windows-event-analysis

## First-Principles Route

- Translate the question into searchable fields such as host, user, process, index, sourcetype, URI, IP, hash, or event code.
- Run broad time-bounded searches first, then narrow by event type, field value, and correlation chain.
- Keep the exact query shape and the evidence field that proves each answer.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: A suspicious binary was downloaded to the endpoint. What was the name of the binary?

- Route type: `dns pivot`
- Why: DNS questions usually reduce to source host, resolver, queried name, response, or packet number pivots.
- Probe: Use elk, splunk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
- Tools: elk, splunk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as dns pivot.
  - Use elk, splunk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `OUTSTANDING_GUTTER.exe`

### Step 2: What is the address the binary was downloaded from? Add http:// to your answer and defang the URL.

- Route type: `dns pivot`
- Why: DNS questions usually reduce to source host, resolver, queried name, response, or packet number pivots.
- Probe: Use elk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as dns pivot.
  - Use elk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `PowerShell command:`

### Step 3: What Windows executable was used to download the suspicious binary? Enter full path.

- Route type: `dns pivot`
- Why: DNS questions usually reduce to source host, resolver, queried name, response, or packet number pivots.
- Probe: Use elk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as dns pivot.
  - Use elk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.

### Step 4: What command was executed to configure the suspicious binary to run with elevated privileges?

- Route type: `elk-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For SIEM (ELK, Splunk, etc.), keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use elk to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as elk-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use elk to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.

### Step 5: binary with elevated privileges?

- Route type: `dns pivot`
- Why: DNS questions usually reduce to source host, resolver, queried name, response, or packet number pivots.
- Probe: Use elk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as dns pivot.
  - Use elk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `do is defang the URL:`

### Step 6: was the name of the file?

- Route type: `elk-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For SIEM (ELK, Splunk, etc.), keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use elk to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as elk-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use elk to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `OUTSTANDING_GUTTER.exe`

### Step 7: the malicious script?

- Route type: `dns pivot`
- Why: DNS questions usually reduce to source host, resolver, queried name, response, or packet number pivots.
- Probe: Use elk, virustotal to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
- Tools: elk, virustotal
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as dns pivot.
  - Use elk, virustotal to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `BlackSun.ps1`

### Step 8: which the ransom note was saved?

- Route type: `elk-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For SIEM (ELK, Splunk, etc.), keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use elk to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as elk-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use elk to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - The proof is the smallest artifact field that directly answers the goal.
- Evidence rule: The proof is the smallest artifact field that directly answers the goal.

### Step 9: also server as an IOC. What is the full path of the image?

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use elk, splunk to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: elk, splunk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use elk, splunk to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `correctly answer all of the questions.`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
