## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Crypto reference for ciphertext, web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: ciphertext, web-app
- Tools: netcat
- Techniques: classical-crypto, crypto-analysis, http-analysis, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Classify the cipher family, encoding layer, and available known-plaintext or structural clues before writing code.
- Separate transport/encoding cleanup from the actual cryptographic break so each assumption can be verified.
- Keep one reproducible decode or solve path that explains why the recovered plaintext is trustworthy.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Crypto, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: BUUCTF-Crypto-rabbit+篱笆墙上的影子（栅栏密码）+RSA题解_ASSOINT的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `cipher decoding`
- Why: Crypto cases should peel encodings first and keep every transformation individually checkable.
- Probe: Use netcat to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as cipher decoding.
  - Use netcat to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `> 来源：[https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_47869330/article/details/110981758](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_47869330/article/details/110981758)`

### Step 3: rabbit：

- Route type: `cipher decoding`
- Why: Crypto cases should peel encodings first and keep every transformation individually checkable.
- Probe: Use netcat to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as cipher decoding.
  - Use netcat to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.

### Step 4: 解题：

- Route type: `cipher decoding`
- Why: Crypto cases should peel encodings first and keep every transformation individually checkable.
- Probe: Use netcat to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as cipher decoding.
  - Use netcat to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.

### Step 5: RSA

- Route type: `cipher decoding`
- Why: Crypto cases should peel encodings first and keep every transformation individually checkable.
- Probe: Use netcat to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as cipher decoding.
  - Use netcat to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
