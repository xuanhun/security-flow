## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Pwn reference for binary challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: binary
- Tools: not detected
- Techniques: binary-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Start from binary properties, architecture, mitigations, and obvious control-flow or memory-corruption primitives.
- Prove the crash or control point first, then derive the shortest control-flow path such as ret2text, ret2libc, or stack pivot.
- Keep offsets, gadgets, and calling assumptions tied to concrete disassembly or debugger evidence.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Pwn, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: NepCTF2021个人赛_Sakura给爷pwn全场的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
