## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Crypto reference for ciphertext, web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: ciphertext, web-app
- Tools: not detected
- Techniques: classical-crypto, crypto-analysis, http-analysis, qr-analysis, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Classify the cipher family, encoding layer, and available known-plaintext or structural clues before writing code.
- Separate transport/encoding cleanup from the actual cryptographic break so each assumption can be verified.
- Keep one reproducible decode or solve path that explains why the recovered plaintext is trustworthy.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Crypto, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: BUUCTF-Crypto-看我回旋踢题解_ASSOINT的博客-CSDN博客_看我回旋踢

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `> 来源：[https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_47869330/article/details/110940053](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_47869330/article/details/110940053)`

### Step 3: ROT13编码

- Route type: `cipher decoding`
- Why: Crypto cases should peel encodings first and keep every transformation individually checkable.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as cipher decoding.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `> ROT13被描述成“杂志字谜上下颠倒解答的Usenet点对点体”。ROT13 也是过去在古罗马开发的凯撒加密的一种变体。`

### Step 4: 特点：

- Route type: `cipher decoding`
- Why: Crypto cases should peel encodings first and keep every transformation individually checkable.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as cipher decoding.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm`

### Step 5: 解题：

- Route type: `cipher decoding`
- Why: Crypto cases should peel encodings first and keep every transformation individually checkable.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as cipher decoding.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `index.php`

### Step 6: （不知道靠不靠谱的）小结：

- Route type: `cipher decoding`
- Why: Crypto cases should peel encodings first and keep every transformation individually checkable.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as cipher decoding.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `好耶！`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
