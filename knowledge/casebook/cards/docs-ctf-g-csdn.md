## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Training and Meta reference for notes challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: notes
- Tools: not detected
- Techniques: study-guide

## First-Principles Route

- Treat the document as study guidance: extract challenge taxonomy, workflow rules, tool references, and reusable habits.
- Record platform names, topic tags, and tool examples so later queries can reach the right note quickly.
- Prefer compact summaries that preserve lookup value over full-text duplication.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Training and Meta, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as evidence lookup.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: 一道CTF题_黑色蒲G英的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
