## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Pwn reference for binary, web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: binary, web-app
- Tools: gdb, netcat, pwntools, strings
- Techniques: binary-exploitation, browser-forensics, command-injection, file-inclusion, malware-static, privilege-escalation, ret2libc, service-enumeration, stego-extraction

## First-Principles Route

- Start from binary properties, architecture, mitigations, and obvious control-flow or memory-corruption primitives.
- Prove the crash or control point first, then derive the shortest control-flow path such as ret2text, ret2libc, or stack pivot.
- Keep offsets, gadgets, and calling assumptions tied to concrete disassembly or debugger evidence.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `gdb-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Pwn, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use gdb, netcat, pwntools, strings to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: gdb, netcat, pwntools, strings
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as gdb-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use gdb, netcat, pwntools, strings to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: PWN shellshock [pwnable.kr]CTF writeup题解系列9_3riC5r的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `file inclusion exploitation`
- Why: Inclusion cases usually start with path control and end with wrapper, traversal, or source disclosure pivots.
- Probe: Use gdb, netcat, pwntools, strings with the extracted filter/query `| \| |__| || \ / || \ | | / _] | |/ ]| \` and inspect the matching evidence.
- Tools: gdb, netcat, pwntools, strings
- Filters or commands:
  - `| \| |__| || \ / || \ | | / _] | |/ ]| \`
  - `| o ) | | || _ || o || o )| | / [_ | ' / | D )`
  - `| _/| | | || | || || || |___ | _] | \ | /`
  - `| | | ` ' || | || _ || O || || [_ __ | \| \`
  - `| | \ / | | || | || || || || || . || . \`
  - `|__| \_/\_/ |__|__||__|__||_____||_____||_____||__||__|\_||__|\_|`
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as file inclusion exploitation.
  - Use gdb, netcat, pwntools, strings with the extracted filter/query `| \| |__| || \ / || \ | | / _] | |/ ]| \` and inspect the matching evidence.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `CVE-2014-6271`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
