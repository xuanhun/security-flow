## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Web reference for email, web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: email, web-app
- Tools: not detected
- Techniques: http-analysis, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Identify the exposed entry point, reflected behavior, trust boundary, and any explicit hints or blacklists.
- Validate the suspected primitive with the smallest payload that proves code/data/control influence.
- Chain the primitive into file read, code execution, auth bypass, or state manipulation only after recording the bypass condition.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: ApacheCN CTF 知识库

- Route type: `ssti exploitation`
- Why: SSTI cases should prove evaluation first, then turn blacklist details into object-traversal or file-read pivots.
- Probe: Use netcat to validate template evaluation with the smallest safe expression, then extend toward controlled object traversal or file read.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as ssti exploitation.
  - Use netcat to validate template evaluation with the smallest safe expression, then extend toward controlled object traversal or file read.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `* [ApacheCN 学习资源](http://docs.apachecn.org/)`

### Step 2: 贡献指南

- Route type: `evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as evidence lookup.

### Step 3: 负责人

- Route type: `command execution path`
- Why: Command execution routes should separate syntax proof, filter bypass, and final file-read or shell step.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to verify command execution or shell expansion with a tiny proof command before reading the target file.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as command execution path.

### Step 4: 其他

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use the artifact-specific tool to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
