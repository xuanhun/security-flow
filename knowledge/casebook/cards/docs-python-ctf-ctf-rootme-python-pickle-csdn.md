## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Web reference for binary, ciphertext, web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: binary, ciphertext, web-app
- Tools: netcat
- Techniques: classical-crypto, crypto-analysis, deserialization, encoding-analysis, http-analysis, php-tricks, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Identify the exposed entry point, reflected behavior, trust boundary, and any explicit hints or blacklists.
- Validate the suspected primitive with the smallest payload that proves code/data/control influence.
- Chain the primitive into file read, code execution, auth bypass, or state manipulation only after recording the bypass condition.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: python 重定向 ctf_CTF-rootme 题解之Python - pickle_深夜利行的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `cipher decoding`
- Why: Crypto cases should peel encodings first and keep every transformation individually checkable.
- Probe: Use netcat to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as cipher decoding.
  - Use netcat to separate encoding cleanup from the actual cipher break and verify the plaintext structure after each step.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `Error response`

### Step 3: Error response

- Route type: `deserialization chain`
- Why: Deserialization cases usually reduce to identifying a controllable object graph and one executable magic-method sink.
- Probe: Use netcat to confirm object injection and map the gadget or magic-method path before building the final payload.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as deserialization chain.
  - Use netcat to confirm object injection and map the gadget or magic-method path before building the final payload.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `pickle反序列化后的对象与原对象是等值的副本对象，类似与deepcopy。`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
