# Network Analysis - Web Shell

## Case Metadata

- Category: `Network Forensics`
- Platform: `BTLO`
- Difficulty: `Easy`
- Source PDF: `https://github.com/tim-barc/ctf_writeups/blob/main/writeups/btlo_network_analysis_web_shell.pdf`

## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Network Forensics reference for pcap, web-service challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: pcap, web-service
- Tools: gobuster, strings, tshark, wireshark
- Techniques: http-analysis, malware-static, network-forensics, stego-extraction, web-enumeration

## First-Principles Route

- Inventory capture files and identify dominant protocols, endpoints, and conversations.
- Prioritize cleartext protocols, credentials, DNS, HTTP objects, files, and suspicious long sessions.
- Use packet filters or stream following to connect each question to a specific packet, stream, or extracted object.
- When a file is recovered from traffic, pivot into file metadata and strings before deeper analysis.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: What is the IP responsible for conducting the port scan activity?

- Route type: `conversation statistics`
- Why: Packet-count questions usually reduce to conversation statistics after endpoint and protocol constraints are fixed.
- Probe: Use wireshark to inspect conversation statistics or packet counts for the constrained endpoints and protocol.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as conversation statistics.
  - Use wireshark to inspect conversation statistics or packet counts for the constrained endpoints and protocol.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `10.251.96.4`

### Step 2: What is the port range scanned by the suspicious host?

- Route type: `conversation statistics`
- Why: Packet-count questions usually reduce to conversation statistics after endpoint and protocol constraints are fixed.
- Probe: Use wireshark to inspect conversation statistics or packet counts for the constrained endpoints and protocol.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as conversation statistics.
  - Use wireshark to inspect conversation statistics or packet counts for the constrained endpoints and protocol.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `You can see that it scans from 1-1024.`

### Step 3: What is the type of port scan conducted?

- Route type: `wireshark-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Network Forensics, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use wireshark to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as wireshark-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use wireshark to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - The proof is the smallest artifact field that directly answers the goal.
- Evidence rule: The proof is the smallest artifact field that directly answers the goal.

### Step 4: Two more tools were used to perform reconnaissance against open ports, what were they?

- Route type: `conversation statistics`
- Why: Packet-count questions usually reduce to conversation statistics after endpoint and protocol constraints are fixed.
- Probe: Use gobuster, strings, wireshark to inspect conversation statistics or packet counts for the constrained endpoints and protocol.
- Tools: gobuster, strings, wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as conversation statistics.
  - Use gobuster, strings, wireshark to inspect conversation statistics or packet counts for the constrained endpoints and protocol.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `results:`

### Step 5: What is the name of the php file through which the attacker uploaded a web shell?

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use wireshark to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use wireshark to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `upload.php`

### Step 6: What is the name of the web shell that the attacker uploaded?

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use wireshark to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use wireshark to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `dbfunctions.php`

### Step 7: What is the parameter used in the web shell for executing commands?

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use wireshark to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use wireshark to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `The parameter used is cmd.`

### Step 8: What is the type of shell connection the attacker obtains through command execution?

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use wireshark to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: wireshark
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use wireshark to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `10.251.96.5`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
