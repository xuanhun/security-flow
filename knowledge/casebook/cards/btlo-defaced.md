# Defaced

## Case Metadata

- Category: `SIEM (ELK, Splunk, etc.)`
- Platform: `BTLO`
- Difficulty: `Easy`
- Source PDF: `https://github.com/tim-barc/ctf_writeups/blob/main/writeups/btlo_defaced.pdf`

## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a SIEM (ELK, Splunk, etc.) reference for siem, web-service challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: siem, web-service
- Tools: elk, nikto
- Techniques: dns-analysis, http-analysis, siem-query, web-enumeration

## First-Principles Route

- Translate the question into searchable fields such as host, user, process, index, sourcetype, URI, IP, hash, or event code.
- Run broad time-bounded searches first, then narrow by event type, field value, and correlation chain.
- Keep the exact query shape and the evidence field that proves each answer.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: threat actor that compromised the website?

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use elk to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use elk to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `Team Apashkirikiri2.0`

### Step 2: What is the scanner used by the attacker to identify the vulnerability?

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use elk, nikto to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: elk, nikto
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use elk, nikto to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `nikto`

### Step 3: Which PHP page is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI)?

- Route type: `dns pivot`
- Why: DNS questions usually reduce to source host, resolver, queried name, response, or packet number pivots.
- Probe: Use elk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as dns pivot.
  - Use elk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `getimagesonly.php`

### Step 4: What is the IP address of the remote attacker?

- Route type: `elk-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For SIEM (ELK, Splunk, etc.), keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use elk to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as elk-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use elk to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `91.192.103.35`

### Step 5: What is the name of the PHP shell?

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use elk to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as http evidence extraction.
  - Use elk to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `backdoor.jpg.php`

### Step 6: What time was the first command executed through the PHP shell?

- Route type: `dns pivot`
- Why: DNS questions usually reduce to source host, resolver, queried name, response, or packet number pivots.
- Probe: Use elk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as dns pivot.
  - Use elk to filter DNS traffic and pivot from source host to queried domain or resolver.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `18/02/2021 11:42:44`

### Step 7: Which config file does the attacker attempt to read using the command 'cat'?

- Route type: `elk-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For SIEM (ELK, Splunk, etc.), keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use elk to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as elk-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use elk to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `/opt/lamp/htdocs/MikePharmaSystem/config.php`

### Step 8: At what time was the database dumped by the attacker?

- Route type: `timeline reconstruction`
- Why: Timeline questions should be answered from normalized artifact timestamps with timezone assumptions recorded.
- Probe: Use elk to align timestamps and identify the event that satisfies the question.
- Tools: elk
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the goal as timeline reconstruction.
  - Use elk to align timestamps and identify the event that satisfies the question.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `18/02/2021 17:14:59`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
