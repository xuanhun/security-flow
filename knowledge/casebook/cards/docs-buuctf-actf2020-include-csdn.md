## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Training and Meta reference for web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: web-app
- Tools: netcat
- Techniques: file-inclusion

## First-Principles Route

- Treat the document as study guidance: extract challenge taxonomy, workflow rules, tool references, and reusable habits.
- Record platform names, topic tags, and tool examples so later queries can reach the right note quickly.
- Prefer compact summaries that preserve lookup value over full-text duplication.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Training and Meta, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: BUUCTF__[ACTF2020 新生赛]Include_题解_风过江南乱的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `file inclusion exploitation`
- Why: Inclusion cases usually start with path control and end with wrapper, traversal, or source disclosure pivots.
- Probe: Use netcat to verify controllable include/read paths and then test the shortest local or wrapper-based read primitive.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as file inclusion exploitation.
  - Use netcat to verify controllable include/read paths and then test the shortest local or wrapper-based read primitive.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
