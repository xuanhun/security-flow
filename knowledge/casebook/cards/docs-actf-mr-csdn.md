## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Web reference for ciphertext, web-app challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: ciphertext, web-app
- Tools: netcat, radare2
- Techniques: classical-crypto, command-injection, crypto-analysis, encoding-analysis, file-inclusion, http-analysis, jwt-analysis, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Identify the exposed entry point, reflected behavior, trust boundary, and any explicit hints or blacklists.
- Validate the suspected primitive with the smallest payload that proves code/data/control influence.
- Chain the primitive into file read, code execution, auth bypass, or state manipulation only after recording the bypass condition.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat, radare2 to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat, radare2
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat, radare2 to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: ACTF题解_Mr_小白先生的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use netcat, radare2 to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: netcat, radare2
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use netcat, radare2 to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `> 来源：[https://blog.csdn.net/qq_41788704/article/details/109046353](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_41788704/article/details/109046353)`

### Step 3: Include

- Route type: `file inclusion exploitation`
- Why: Inclusion cases usually start with path control and end with wrapper, traversal, or source disclosure pivots.
- Probe: Use netcat to verify controllable include/read paths and then test the shortest local or wrapper-based read primitive.
- Tools: netcat
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as file inclusion exploitation.
  - Use netcat to verify controllable include/read paths and then test the shortest local or wrapper-based read primitive.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `55cd8fcb3eddd5fd5632ce21b4aeb045`

### Step 4: exec

- Route type: `netcat-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use netcat, radare2 to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: netcat, radare2
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as netcat-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use netcat, radare2 to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `30029f71a1676a12fce3d010e362f202`

### Step 5: backupfile

- Route type: `file inclusion exploitation`
- Why: Inclusion cases usually start with path control and end with wrapper, traversal, or source disclosure pivots.
- Probe: Use netcat, radare2 with the extracted filter/query `if($key == $str) {` and inspect the matching evidence.
- Tools: netcat, radare2
- Filters or commands:
  - `if($key == $str) {`
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as file inclusion exploitation.
  - Use netcat, radare2 with the extracted filter/query `if($key == $str) {` and inspect the matching evidence.
  - Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Evidence rule: Trust the result only when the extracted evidence line or field directly supports it.
- Result: `flag.php`

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
