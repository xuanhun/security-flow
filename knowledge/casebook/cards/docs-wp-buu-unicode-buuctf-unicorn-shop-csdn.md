## Why This Case Matters

Use this case as a Web reference for web-app, web-service challenges.

## Input Signals

- Artifacts: web-app, web-service
- Tools: burp
- Techniques: encoding-analysis, http-analysis, web-exploitation

## First-Principles Route

- Identify the exposed entry point, reflected behavior, trust boundary, and any explicit hints or blacklists.
- Validate the suspected primitive with the smallest payload that proves code/data/control influence.
- Chain the primitive into file read, code execution, auth bypass, or state manipulation only after recording the bypass condition.

## Solve Thinking

### Step 1: Document

- Route type: `burp-driven evidence lookup`
- Why: For Web, keep every answer tied to one artifact, one probe, and one proof field.
- Probe: Use burp to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
- Tools: burp
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as burp-driven evidence lookup.
  - Use burp to collect the smallest evidence slice that answers the goal.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Result: `-->`

### Step 2: [WP/BUU/Unicode编码]BUUCTF Unicorn shop题解_車鈊的博客-CSDN博客

- Route type: `http evidence extraction`
- Why: HTTP questions usually reduce to request metadata, response body, host/URI correlation, or object extraction.
- Probe: Use burp to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
- Tools: burp
- Reasoning chain:
  - Recognize the section as http evidence extraction.
  - Use burp to inspect HTTP requests, hosts, URIs, headers, and response bodies.
  - Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.
- Evidence rule: Treat the extracted answer as proven only after locating the source artifact field that produced it.

## Reuse Checklist

- Match the new challenge's artifact and question shape against this case before copying any tool sequence.
- Start from the same evidence class, then adapt filters, fields, and timestamps to the new artifact.
- Promote any repeated manual action into a skill command before relying on it for the final solve.
